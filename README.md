# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis — Using Basic Python

A simple and beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes student performance using **only core Python concepts** — no external libraries required.  

This project was created as part of the **Insight Hunt** competition to demonstrate how even basic Python logic (like loops, lists, and conditionals) can be used to find meaningful insights from data.

## 🌟 Features

✅ Uses only **basic Python** — no libraries like pandas or matplotlib  
✅ Calculates average marks for each subject  
✅ Finds top and lowest performing students  
✅ Compares average scores between boys and girls  
✅ Generates easy-to-understand insights from raw data
